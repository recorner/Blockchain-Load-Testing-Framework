# Blockchain Load Testing Framework

The Blockchain Load Testing Framework is a load testing tool that measures the performance of blockchain networks under various conditions. This tool can generate high volumes of transactions, measure network latency, and monitor resource usage for different blockchain implementations.

# Features
- Generates high volumes of transactions for load testing blockchain networks
- Measures network latency and monitors resource usage
- Supports multiple blockchain implementations
- Provides detailed performance reports for analysis
## Installation
To install the Blockchain Load Testing Framework, you must first have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/.

Once you have Go installed, you can install the Blockchain Load Testing Framework using the following command:
- go get github.com/blockchain-load-testing-framework

# Usage
To use the Blockchain Load Testing Framework, you must first create a configuration file with the desired parameters for your load testing. You can use the config.go file in the src directory as a starting point.

Next, you can run the load testing using the following command:
- go run main.go
This will generate a performance report in CSV format, which you can analyze using a spreadsheet program or data analysis tool of your choice.
